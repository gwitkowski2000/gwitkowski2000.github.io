                <br>
                <p>Hello! I'm Grzegorz Witkowski, an enthusiastic embedded systems developer specializing in
                    microcontrollers. With a passion for creating efficient and reliable firmware, I have dedicated the
                    last four years to mastering the art of embedded programming and hardware integration.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My journey began with a fascination for electronics and a knack for problem-solving. This led me to
                    pursue a degree in Automation and Robotics from Kielce University of Technology, where I honed my
                    skills in C/C++, embedded software design, and the usage of various industrial sensors and
                    actuators. Over the years, I've had the pleasure of working on a variety of projects, from
                    developing firmware for IoT devices and home automation to a robot competing in international
                    competitions (together with the team I've even won 1st and 4th places in European Rover Challenge as
                    well as 5th place in University Rover Challenge)
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Beyond coding, I am a firm believer in continuous learning and staying updated with the latest
                    industry trends. When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me tinkering with electronics,
                    exploring new technologies, or sharing my knowledge.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations, interesting projects, or
                    just chat about all things embedded systems!
